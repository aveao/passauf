## International travel without an eMRTD

I'm titling this as "travel without an eMRTD", and not "travle without a passport, because various countries let others' nationals enter with an ID alone. See the "International civil travel without passports" infodump section.

Here's some of the exclusions to travel without eMRTDs that I know:
- Military travel [does not require passports](https://www.ramstein.af.mil/About/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/303670/travel-documents/), instead using things like Military IDs and NATO travel orders.
- Working seafarers can get [Seaman's books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafarers%27_Identity_Documents_Convention,_1958) and [cards](https://www.gov.uk/get-seamans-discharge-book-or-british-seamans-card), which let working them enter the ports they stop on, sometimes also having additional visa exemptions.
- Same applies to aircrew sometimes, [they may be able to use their airline IDs for visa exemption before their next flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_crew_members) (country-dependent).


However, official/diplomatic travel etc do [use their own passport types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport#Diplomatic_and_official_passports) and can still be required to get visas depending on state of diplomatic relations between countries. The weirdest such passports I know are:
- [Queen's/King's Messengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Messenger) in the UK, which transport some of the more sensitive [diplomatic baggage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_bag) for the UK.
- [Sovereign Military Order of Malta passport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_Military_Order_of_Malta_passport). [SMOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_Military_Order_of_Malta) is a chivalric religious order that [runs the humanitarian aid organization Malteser International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malteser_International) (you may have seen their ambulances around if you're in Germany). Despite the name, they're based in Italy, not Malta. Their diplomatic corps get the passport, and [it's accepted in some places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_holders_of_passports_issued_by_the_Sovereign_Military_Order_of_Malta) which is impressive considering what they are (the map is outdated, check the list).

## International civil travel without passports

- Various trade blocs, regional cooperation unions, etc allow travel to other members with a national ID alone.
    - EU IDs can be used to travel to all of EU and Schengen for indefinite travel.
        - Non-EU Schengen member IDs (Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Switzerland) can be used to travel to all of EU and Schengen for up to 90 days ([source](https://oslo.diplo.de/no-de/service/2640666-2640666)).
        - EU member states, and some EEA states, are required by EU law to issue eMRTDs by [Regulation (EU) 2019/1157](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/1157/oj). As far as I know however, the old style IDs still suffice for travel inside EU.
    - Same for [Mercosur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercosur) (Southern Common Market / Mercado Com√∫n del Sur).
        - That said, only some issue eMRTDs as their IDs (Argentina does). Some don't (Brazil).
            - Argentina's pre-2024 IDs don't fully comply as they do not show the Chip Inside symbol (`[o]`), and MRZ does not match the correct alignment for document size. [It will only be properly compliant once 2024 series of IDs releases](https://regulaforensics.com/blog/argentine-id-card-processing/).
    - Same for [ECOWAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECOWAS) (Economic Community of West African States).
        - Unclear if any IDs are currently eMRTD (didn't have time to look it up), but [they're working on a common ID format called ENBIC](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202410/ecowas-agrees-to-accelerate-implementation-of-enbic-regional-id-card-for-stronger-integration) that appears to be intending to be an eMRTD.
    - Same for [GCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Cooperation_Council) (Gulf Cooperation Council).
        - [Emirates ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_national_identity_card) is an eMRTD, based on pictures Qatar ID doesn't seem to be one, rest is unknown to me.
- Some countries IDs can be used for travel past their respective trade bloc too:
    - [French nationals can go to a number of non EU/schengen countries with an ID alone](https://www.bluevalet.fr/en/blog/42-countries-in-which-to-travel-without-a-passport), namely Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Turkey, Tunisia (only with a tour), and Egypt.
        - And probably more too, see the Wikipedia claims below.
    - [Turkey allows many countries' nationals to enter with an ID alone](https://www.mfa.gov.tr/countries-whose-citizens-are-allowed-to-enter-T%C3%BCrkiye-with-their-national-id_s.en.mfa), probably to encourage tourism.
        - Similarly, Turkish nationals can travel to [a few countries](https://www.turkishairlines.com/en-de/any-questions/visa-and-travel-requirements/) (list at bottom) with just a national ID card, which is an eMRTD.
    - [This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_identity_cards_in_the_European_Economic_Area_and_Switzerland) also claims...
        - that Egypt also allows various countries to enter with an ID alone. I cannot find recent sources for a list, but [Timatic confirms german nationals can use their ID](https://www.timaticweb2.com/integration/external-result/r1Y1GHaVw2x7MA4b-B-ph0OqdduJ9Q) (I didn't check the rest).
        - that one can travel to Anguilla, Dominica, Saint Lucia, Guernsey and Jersey with a French ID alone. No sources cited. [Timatic agrees partly for Anguilla, but restrictions apply on departure location](https://www.timaticweb2.com/integration/external-result/r1Y1GHaUkm1wYV8Zr0Wpg5m5_X8SPQ), I didn't check the rest.
        - that Gambia allows nationals of Belgium to travel with just an ID card. [Timatic agrees](https://www.timaticweb2.com/integration/external-result/r1Y1GHaWk21zMVhCrUSu037dlvNl-A).
        - that Greenland allows Nordic citizens to travel with any photo ID (?!). [Timatic kind of agrees](https://www.timaticweb2.com/integration/external-result/r1Y1GHaXwzggOw8f-0P_1kYDyzNZ_g).
- Generally: UK is a complex one. UK does not have a national ID system, nor do they have a mandate to carry ID. It's also arguable if UK is truly made up of multiple countries, or if they just call their version of states countries (not a rare concept, see cantons and prefectures).
    - UK citizens can however travel to Ireland without a passport by carrying other proof of UK citizenship (birth certificate?): https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ireland/entry-requirements
    - Similarly, [Republic of Ireland citizens can travel to UK with only an ID](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/common-travel-area-between-ireland-and-the-uk/), though the official guidance notes that some carriers refuse anything but a passport.
    - [You can travel from Crown Dependencies (Jersey, Guernsey, Isle of Man) to UK without a passport](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travelling-between-the-uk-and-ireland-isle-of-man-guernsey-or-jersey#crown-dependencies), but instead any form of official identity document, including passport cards, driver's licenses and armed forces IDs.
